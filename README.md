This project is aimed to help students who are struggling with English at school because English is not their first language. EduBridge allows you to type in any school topic, translate it into your native language, and then generate videos about your topic in your native language.
Additionally, the study tool Quizlet has required student to pay for Quizlet plus to access some of it study tools, so EduBridge allows you to paste a quizlet link, and it will generate different study modes and tests for free for students to study. It also comes with a multiplayer study game you can play with a friend, and you can generate videos about your Quizlet topic in your native language as well.
Enjoy!
